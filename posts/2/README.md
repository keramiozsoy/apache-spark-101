## What are the programming models on Apache Spark

There are two different major programming models in Spark.

- Apache Spark RDD (the oldest style)
- Apache Spark SQL (newer API than RDDs) (Data frame, DataSets APIs)

If you're interested in other things, here are the other libraries

- Apache Spark MLib ( Machine learning library )
- Apache Spark GraphX ( Graph processing )
- Apache Spark DStreams ( Realtime streams on data )
